<h1>Setsuna and the Yellow Dragon</h1>
<h3>Written By Aidan Engle: 2022</h3>

<p>Setsuna Komali is a hero who lives in a small village called Hachikō on an island called Hachichō. She is a famous hero who is always there to save the day with her dragon friend, Pit. Setsuna is considered the best hero in the world by many people. In her kind nature, she always avoids fighting as much as possible and attempts to talk and negotiate without violence. She carries a sword on her back with a half piece of a shining crystal on its handle, but she rarely ever uses it. <br>
Setsuna and her village enjoyed peaceful times for many months. Until one day...</p>
<br>

<p>It is a beautiful morning and Setsuna is getting up out of bed.</p>
<img src="images/Setsuna-morning2.png" class="img3" alt="Setsuna getting up out of bed.">
<br>

<p>“Yawn*, Morning already? I guess it's time to water the garden and work on Freddy’s computer.
	<br>
	I've gotta get dressed!” Setsuna said.</p>
<br>
<img class="img2" src="images/Setsuna.png" alt="Setsuna Komali">
<p>Even when she is not acting as a hero, Setsuna still has other responsibilities, such as watering her plants and working on computer-related projects. The people of Hachikō didn’t rely on computers that much, but they have been using them for work efficiency and entertainment as of late. Setsuna happens to know more about computers than anyone in the town. Today, Setsuna was going to fix a computer problem for her neighbor, Freddy. She was on her way but, suddenly, two green birds flew in! One was a blue-eyed parrot with a wacky hairdo and a long neck. The other one was a Pigeon with orange eyes and a dark green neck band.</p>
<img class="img" src="images/green-parrot.jpg" class="img3" alt="Green Parrot">
<img class="img" src="images/Aidan-Engle-- Pigeon-Icon.png" class ="img3" alt="Green Pigeon">
<p>The parrot spoke. “YELLOW DRAGON! YELLOW DRAGON! WATCH OUT, THE YELLOW DRAGON IS COMING TO YOUR TOWN! EVERYONE RUN!” The Pigeon followed with a “COO! COO! COOCCOOCOCOCOCO COCOCOCOCOCOO!</p>
<br>

<p>“Yellow Dragon?” Setsuna questioned. “Yes! The Yellow Dragon is coming to the town of Hachikō! We came from our home, Big Beak Island to warn you!” The parrot squawked. The pigeon continued to coo. “Okay, so let me guess… you two live on an island full of birds called Big Beak Island and there was an evil yellow dragon there that tried to take over your island. Then it decided to leave and find another town which ended up being my town, Hachikō?” Setsuna assumed.</p>
<br>

<p>“Ummm… YES! EXACTLY! Everything that you said was right! How did you know?” The parrot said. The pigeon cooed in question. “Well, I didn’t know exactly… I just have excellent intuition! That’s all.” Setsuna said. “I’d say. You really do have fantastic intuition! I guess I should have expected that from the famous Setsuna! You are Setsuna, right?” the parrot said.<br>
 “Yes I am. By the way, you never told me your name! What is it? And what about the pigeon?"" Setsuna said. “Oh me. I am Chuck the Parrot and this is my friend Jerry the Pigeon!” Chuck said. “That’s cool!” Setsuna said.  “Coo coo, coooooooooooo cooooooooooooooo!” Jerry said. “Yeah, you’re right, Jerry. The dragon. Getting back on track, the Yellow Dragon is coming to Hachikō, and he plans on destroying the entire village and making the entire island his nesting ground! We all need to leave!” Chuck squawked! <br>
 “Why? I can deal with this Yellow Dragon!” Setsuna said. “No! You don’t understand! The Yellow Dragon is the most evil and formidable monster on Earth! He’s too dangerous for even you! Not even Bird Brain, the strongest on Big Beak Island, could take him! You can’t fight or negotiate with him! Even if we got the strongest heroes all together with you, Cheetah Mac, and Leopard Joe, it wouldn’t be enough! The best thing to do is RUN!!!” Chuck yelled. <br>
 “COOOOO COO COCOCOCOCOO COOCOCOCOOO COOCOCOOCCOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Jerry screeched!
<br>
<br>
“What is all of this noise! You woke up Jenny!” Freddy yelled as he opened the door to see what happened while carrying his baby daughter, Jenny. “Birds? What are these birds doing here and Setsuna?” “Listen to me! The whole island needs to evacuate because the Yellow Dragon is coming! The most fearsome creature on Earth!” Chuck yelled.” “What are you blabbing about, bird! I don’t have time for these games! And besides, we have Setsuna! She wouldn’t lose to some silly dragon.” Freddy said. “Freddy is right, Chuck and Jerry. You too are forgetting that I am Setsuna, the strongest hero on Earth. I would never let my friends or anyone else get destroyed by some silly dragon. I actually have a dragon as my sidekick! Even if it is dangerous, I have to do this for my people! This is my town and my island, so I AM going to STOP this Yellow Dragon! NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP ME!!! I AM GOING AFTER THAT DRAGON AND HE WILL NOT MAKE IT TO HACHIKŌ! Where is the dragon now?” Setsuna yelled. <br>
“He is probably somewhere near Ging Island by now, but you shouldn’t go!” Chuck squaked. “Okie dokie! Thank you very much Chuck! OHHH PIT!!!” Setsuna called. Then her dragon friend came flying and stumbled across the ground. Setsuna jumped on to Pit’s back and they both flew off! Setsuna waved. “GOODBYE CHUCK AND JERRY! I’M GOING TO SEE THE YELLOW DRAGON!!!” Setsuna yelled.</p>
<img class="img3" src="images/dragon-illustration-clipart.jpg" alt="Pit the Dragon">
<p>“COOOOOOO!! COOOCOCOCO OC OCO C OCO COC COCCOCOCOOOO!” Jerry cooed fiercely! “NO!!! COME BACK SETSUNA!!! YOU CANNOT FIGHT THE YELLOW DRAGON!!!” Chuck yelled. “Yeah! Go get them Setsuna! Just don’t forget about my computer!” Freddy yelled.</p>
<br>

<img class="img3" src="images/Setsuna-and-Pit.jpg"  alt="Setsuna riding Pit through the sky as they move away from home.">
<p>Setsuna and Pit were high in the sky now. “So where to this time Setsuna?” Pit said. “We’re going to Ging Island to stop the evil Yellow Dragon that wants to take over Hachichō!” Setsuna said. “The Yellow Dragon... hmmm... I know him! He is a castaway in the dragon community in Dragon Heights. He was mean and evil, and we sent him away into prison so that he couldn’t hurt people. He must have broken out! The Yellow Dragon is no joke, so I hope that you're prepared Setsuna! That Yellow Dragon is one tough customer!” Pit said. “Trust me, those two birds made that very clear!” Setsuna said. “Okay! We are approaching Ging island so be ready to land!” Pit said. “Roger that, Pit!” Setsuna said in response.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/caribbean-island-coast-1457017085crp.jpg" alt="Ging Island">
<p>Setsuna and Pit were about to land on Ging island, but a large cannonball was headed their way and Pit’s wing was hit! “WE HAVE BEEN HIT! MAYDAY! MAYDAY! Get ready for a rough landing Setsuna!” Pit yelled. “OH NOOOOOOOOOOO!” Setsuna screamed! They crash landed on the coastline off Ging island.</p>
<img class="img3" src="images/pirate-ship-in-caribbean-1488476271Ubu.jpg" alt="Pirate Ship">
<p>Suddenly they heard a voice. “Argh, I think we’ve got em boys! To think, Setsuna, coming to our island! I’ll never let her steal my treasure! Argh! She should have stayed home and tended to her flowers! Girls aren’t meant to fight! They’re weak and stupid! Her being number one hero is a lie!” The voice said. “You’re the best, Captain BoneBurt!” A bunch of other voices yelled.</p>
<img class="img2" src="images/cropped-pirate-statue-15281169179tt.png" alt="Captain BoneBurt">
<img class="img" src="images/Angry-Setsuna.png" alt="Angry Setsuna">
<p>“WHAT WAS ALL OF THAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME!” Setsuna said as she opened her eyes to see a group of evil pirates. “ARGH! She’s still alive!?” The Captain said in shock. “I’ll have you know that girls are just as capable as boys are! I thought that people were starting to accept that, but of course there are some that don’t, and they happen to be thieving pirates from The Skeleton Patch Pirates. You guys are the worst! I’ve heard all about you Captain BoneBurt! You’ve destroyed islands and stole belongings from innocent people! You have no shame, and you have the nerve to insult me for being a woman, attack me and my friend, and stop me from saving my village from the Yellow Dragon! Well, your reign of terror ends today! I will defeat you and send you all to jail! I will heal Pit and return your stolen items to their rightful owners!” Setsuna yelled! “Yeah, you and what army?” Captain BoneBurt said. “Ha, army? I can take you all on by myself with my eyes closed!” Setsuna said.<br>
“Let’s see you try, land lover girl!” Setsuna then leapt into action with her sword in hand. She was going after the pirates and was too fast for their eyes! She knocked out each pirate with ease! She then entered a one-on-one sword fight with Captain BoneBurt. <br>
They were locked in combat with their swords. “Argh! You’ll never take me, Setsuna! I am Captain BoneBurt, and I’ve never lost a fight!"" Captain BoneBurt yelled as the swords clashed. “Well, that’s about to change! I’ve never lost a fight either, and I’ll never lose to some dirty pirate while the whole world needs me!” Setsuna yelled. The two of them jumped up onto Captain BoneBurt’s pirate ship! They fought everywhere and practically tore the ship apart, climbing up poles, jumping off of the deck and slamming doors. “Ha! This is not a challenge at all, matey! I am definitely going to win this one!” Captain BoneBurt yelled. “Oh yeah, well I’m just getting warmed up. Now I’m going to show you my true strength!” Setsuna said. “WHAT!? NO WAY!?” Captain BoneBurt yelled in shock. Setsuna sped up and landed blow upon blow onto the captain at high speeds, and they jumped near the plank. “NOOO! ARGH! I TAKE IT BACK! GIRLS AREN’T DUMB! I WAS JUST KIDDING! IT WAS MY CREW! THEY WOULD HAVE THROWN THEIR CAPTAIN OVERBOARD IF I DIDN’T SAY IT! IT WAS ALL THE CREW! I AM ACTUALLY A NICE GUY! ALL I WANT IS PEEEEAAAACEEEE!” Captain BoneBurt yelled in fear. “Argh! So that is how ye see your crew. Just slaves that you can use to get what you want! Well, we will never be loyal to you again! It is time for you to stop, Captain. We promise that we will never steal again, Setsuna. We will not honor a leader like you, BoneBurt! Let’s go, pirates! ATTACK!!!” <br><br>
One of the crewmates yelled. “ARGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!” The pirates yelled as they charged at Captain BoneBurt. “NO! Me own crew is turning on me! See, this is what I told you, Setsuna!” Captain BoneBurt yelled.  “I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOUR LIES! TAKE THIS!!!” Setsuna yelled as she swung the finishing blow knocking the sword out of Captain BoneBurt’s hand as he was knocked to the plank! “NO NOOOO! I’M SORRY, I’LL BE A GOOD PIRATE! I WILL GO TO JAIL WITH AND ATONE FOR MY EVIL DEEDS!” Captain BoneBurt pleaded. “It’s time for ye to walk the plank!” Setsuna said. “NO! DON’T DO IT!” Captain BoneBurt cried. “No I’m just kidding! I’m just going to tie you up so that you can be locked up. That’s all.  I would never kill anyone!” Setsuna said. “Phew. That’s a relief. I’m sorry about everything that I said. You proved to me that girls are strong.” Captain BoneBurt said. “It took you long enough to realize…” Setsuna said as she tied the Captain up. She gathered all of the stolen loot and prepared to give it back. She gave Pit some healing herbs too. “I feel much better now! Still, where is the Yellow Dragon?” Pit said.</p>
<br>
<img class="img2" src="images/Setsuna-sword.png" alt="Setsuna holding her Sword">
<p>Suddenly, there was a strong wind as shadows covered the ground. “Argh! Shiver me timbers, what is that!” One of the pirates yelled! “Gasp* It’s the Yellow Dragon!” Setsuna yelled.</p>
<img src="images/golden-young-dragon.jpg" alt="The Yellow Dragon">
<p>The Yellow Dragon was massive and flew over Ging Island. Setsuna jumped on top of Pit and yelled, “After him!” as they flew after the Yellow Dragon. “Hey, Yellow Dragon! OVER HERE!” Setsuna yelled. The large Dragon turned around and flew towards them. “AAAAAAAAH! The Yellow Dragon! I’m not scared… I’M NOT SCARED OF YOU!” Pit yelled. “PIT? IS THAT YOU!? YOU WERE ONE OF THE DRAGONS FROM DRAGON HEIGHTS THAT KICKED ME OUT! HOW DARE YOU! YOU’RE ALSO HERE TO FIGHT WITH A HUMAN! THIS IS OUR BATTLE!” “STOP IT! Pit is my friend and it is actually me who is picking a fight! Why are you trying to destroy Hachikō!? I don’t want to fight, but I have to protect my home! One way or another, I will stop you Yellow, Dragon!” Setsuna yelled. “HAHAHA, OH NO, I AM SOOOO SCARED, THE LITTLE HUMAN THINKS THAT SHE CAN STOP ME! I AM SOOO SCARED! MY END IS NEAR! GET A LIFE! YOU IF YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN DEFEAT ME THEN YOU’RE A LOT DUMBER THAN YOU LOOK!  WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ANYWAY?” The Yellow Dragon asked. <br>
"Oh me? I am Setsuna Komali of course!” Setsuna said. “SETSUNA!? YOU’RE SETSUNA, THAT HERO THAT EVERYONE IS BLABBING ABOUT!” The Yellow Dragon said. “Yep,” Setsuna said in response. The Yellow Dragon towered over Setsuna and Pit. “FOR SOME REASON, I EXPECTED YOU TO BE TALLER AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!” The Yellow Dragon said in a patronizing voice. “Size doesn’t matter! Setsuna will win this fight! She is the strongest warrior on Earth! You might as well give up!” Pit yelled. “HA STRONGEST WARRIOR! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! YOU MAY BE STRONGER THAN ALL OF THE HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS ON THIS PLANE,T BUT YOU’LL NEVER REACH MY STRENGTH! AND PIT THINKS THAT I SHOULD QUIT! OH NOOO! I AM SO SCARED OF SETSUNA! HELP ME! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!” The Yellow Dragon said sarcastically. The Yellow Dragon shot a large fireball out of his mouth and it hit Pit! Pit flew above the Yellow Dragon with his remaining strength and yelled, “SETSUNA, JUMP!” and Setsuna jumped off and landed on the Yellow Dragon’s back. Pit landed back onto Ging island to recover from the hit. “GET OFF OF ME, HUMAN!” The Yellow Dragon yelled. Setsuna was on top of the Yellow Dragon and held on as he twisted and turned. Her hair blew in the air and her sword almost flew away! <br>
“We don’t need to have this fight Yellow Dragon! Why don’t you just give up your evil ways!? I won’t have to hurt you then!” Setsuna yelled. “HAHAHAHA! ‘CHANGE MY WAYS!?’ YOU’RE HILARIOUS! I WOULD NEVER CHANGE MY WAYS! DESTROYING STUFF IS TOO MUCH FUN!” The Yellow Dragon yelled. He then flung Setsuna into the air! “You won’t defeat me that easily!” Setsuna yelled as she was suspended in midair. Setsuna regained composure and dove downwards and grabbed the Yellow Dragon’s tail! She held onto the dragon with all of her might and used her sword to fight against the wind! The pirates fired their cannons at the dragon. Even the combined power of Setsuna's sword and the pirate's cannonballs weren't making a dent on the dragon!! The dragon was winning. “Am I really not strong enough to win this fight? Can…   I…  actually…    win?” Setsuna thought.</p>
<br>

<p>Suddenly someone else showed up! It was Chuck the Parrot and Jerry the Pigeon! “Coo cooc ococoococococ” Jerry said. “Gasp* It’s the Yellow Dragon! Wait it’s Setsuna! Setsuna, I finally found you! Since you’re so intent on this fight, I got you something! A very treasured item from Big Beak island! The Hyperdrive Heart Crystal! It is actually the other half of the crystal on your sword! It actually came from Dragon Heights! It was thrown away to us. There was no use for it because no had the heart to use it! The Yellow Dragon tried to use i3t, but it didn’t work because he is evil. But you have the Pure Heart to use it, Setsuna! Put it in your sword! It is the only way to beat the dragon!” Chuck said. Setsuna put the crystal in the sword and it reacted to the power of Setsuna’s pure heart! There was a bright shine transforming into a brilliant sword of light! “WHAT IS GOING ON!? WHAT!? SHE HAS THE HYPERDRIVE HEART CRYSTAL IN HER SWORD!!!” The Yellow Dragon yelled in fear. “The Hikari Sword… the light sword that  outshines any dark force’. This is the legendary sword of legend! Yes. My True Power is Awakening!!!!!</p>
<img class="img2" src="images/Super-Setsuna.png" alt ="Super Setsuna with a shining gold light surrounding her with spiked bright gold colored hair with her back hair smoothly floating back. She is holding the shining bright Hikari Sword with a blindingly bright light.">
<br>

<p>Setsuna shined with a brilliant light! Her hair turned light gold with a shining power. She floated in the air with an intense energy. “NOOOOOOOOOO! THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING!!! SHE HAS SUPER POWER NOW!” The Yellow Dragon screamed. “YOUR REIGN OF TERROR ENDS NOW, YELLOW DRAGON!  I AM SETSUNA KOMALI AND I WILL DEFEAT YOU!” Super Setsuna said. Setsuna sprung into action and landed blow after blow to the Yellow Dragon as she flew through the air at blinding speeds. “FOR THE WORLD!!! THIS IS IT!” Super Setsuna yelled. She landed the final blow, knocking the Yellow Dragon out of the sky. They all landed on Ging Island</p>
<br>
<img class="img2" src="images/Super-Setsuna-Sword-purple.png" alt="Super Setsuna holding the Hikari Sword">
<p>“Argh. Her power is just incredible!” one of the pirates said. “Yellow Dragon, please go back to the dragon jail and think about what you did. This fight is over. I know that you can change if you put your mind to it. You and the pirates can do your time together.” Super Setsuna said. “BUT WHY AREN’T YOU GOING TO FINISH ME? WHAT IF I COME BACK?” The Yellow Dragon said. “Setsuna Komali does not kill.” Pit said. “I know that you won’t come back to cause harm," Super Setsuna said. " You have definitely changed. It’s my intuition. Let’s get things back to normal. I will return Pit back home to get him healed. I will also return all of the loot that the pirates stole to their rightful owners. I will take the Yellow Dragon and the Pirates to the dragon jail so they can all think about their actions together, and I will take Chuck and Jerry back to Big Beak Island.” Super Setsuna said. She first took Pit home at blinding speeds and asked their Doctor Riki to help Pit, and he accepted. “By the way, Setsuna. HOW ARE YOU FLYING, AND WHY IS YOUR HAIR GOLDEN!?!?” Doctor Riki asked in confusion and shock. “With the power of my Pure Heart!” Setsuna said as she flew off at blinding speeds. “WAIT SETSUNA! COME BACK!” Doctor Riki yelled. Setsuna then flew and took all of the pirate loot back to their owners. She then took the pirates and the Yellow Dragon to the dragon jail in Dragon Heights. “Argh, we promise that we will change, and if we don’t, make me walk the plank!” Captain BoneBurt said. “Thank you Setsuna for finally locking the Yellow Dragon behind bars again(along with the pirates I guess…). The Dragon chief said to Setsuna. “No problem!” Setsuna said. Setsuna took Chuck the Parrot and Jerry the Pigeon back home to Big Beak Island. “I can’t believe it. You were truly able to master the power of the Hyperdrive Heart Crystal. It’s very incredible! No one has ever had a pure enough heart to do this! Treasure this crystal and your new power and use it to protect the world!” Chuck said. “COOOO COOOO COCO COO! WELL DONE! COO.” Jerry said. “Thank you very much Chuck and Jerry! I promise to protect this crystal with my life!” Super Setsuna said as she flew away. Super Setsuna was now flying through the air when a thought entered her mind. “Hey, wait a minute… did Jerry just talk!?” She thought. She continued to fly home. On the way she passed Cheetah Mac and Leopard Joe. </p>
<img class="img" src="images/cartoon-leopard.jpg" alt="Leopard Joe">
<img class="img2" src="images/Cheetah-Mac.png"  alt="Cheetah Mac">
<p>“Oh my gosh! What was that gold light! It was faster than me. Could it be that blue hedgehog going super? Nah.” Cheetah Mac said. “It looks like you finally have some competition Cheetah Mac!” Leopard Joe said. Setsuna also passed the Duck of Truth and Cookie the Penguin.</p>
<img class="img2" src="images/Cookie-The-Penguin-Animation-edi.gif" alt="Cookie the Penguin">
<img class="img2" src="images/The-Duck-Of-Truth!4-edi-char.png" alt="The Duck of Truth">
<p>“WHAT WAS THAT!? WAS IT CHEETAH MAC!?” Cookie the Penguin questioned. “No. It was Setsuna!” The Duck of Truth said in response.</p>
<br>

<p>Finally, Super Setsuna landed home and reverted from her Super State and the Hikari Sword returned to normal as well. The entire village was there and cheered her on for saving the day! Pit was back to full health too! “I guess I will put this crystal away for safekeeping and save it for big emergencies. I want to rely on my own strength and maybe one day achieve Super without the Hyperdrive Heart Crystal,” Setsuna said as she put away the crystal. “Yawn* I’m tired, I think I’m going to go to bed. Oh yeah, I have to remember to fix Freddy’s computer tomorrow. Maybe I’ll take a vacation to Big Beak Island one day as long as there is no evil threat. Ahh, I can dream. Being the world’s symbol of peace is a tough job… Zzzzzzzzzz.” Setsuna said as she fell asleep.  And they all lived happily ever after.</p>
